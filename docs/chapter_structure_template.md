## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Code Examples**: All code should be tested in Databricks Community Edition to ensure it works as described

2. **Visual Elements**: Include diagrams, charts, or screenshots to illustrate complex concepts where appropriate

3. **Progression**: Structure each chapter to progress from simpler to more complex concepts

4. **Real-World Relevance**: Connect theoretical concepts to practical applications throughout

5. **Accessibility**: Use clear, concise language and avoid unnecessary jargon

6. **Interactivity**: Design examples and exercises to be interactive and engaging

7. **Assessment Alignment**: Ensure review questions and exercises align with learning objectives

8. **Consistent Voice**: Maintain a consistent, conversational but authoritative voice throughout
